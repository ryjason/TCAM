# TCAM — Traffic-Camera Air-Quality Model

## What is TCAM?
TCAM is a lightweight research project that estimates **PM2.5 air-quality levels** from **traffic-camera images**. It can work image-only or fuse images with weather metadata (e.g., temperature, wind, humidity) to improve predictions. The goal is to turn widely available traffic feeds into useful, timely air-quality signals.

## Mission
- **Democratize air-quality insights** by leveraging existing camera infrastructure—no new sensors required.
- **Enable rapid, low-cost monitoring** where traditional stations are sparse or delayed.
- **Advance open research** with reproducible pipelines for data fetching, labeling, training, evaluation, and inference.
- **Inform public health and city operations** with actionable PM2.5 estimates, especially during high-pollution events.

> Status: active research / WIP. Expect changes as we iterate.
